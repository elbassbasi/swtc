/**
 * <code>WGridData</code> is the layout data object associated with
 * <code>WGridLayout</code>. To set a <code>WGridData</code> object into a
 * control, you use the <code>WControl.SetLayoutData(WGridData)</code> method.
 * <p>
 * There are two ways to create a <code>WGridData</code> object with certain
 * fields set. The first is to set the fields directly, like this:
 * <pre>
 * 		WGridData gridData;
 * 		gridData.horizontalAlignment = WGridData::FILL;
 * 		gridData.grabExcessHorizontalSpace = true;
 * 		button1.SetLayoutData(gridData);
 *
 * 		WGridData gridData();
 * 		gridData.horizontalAlignment = WGridData::FILL;
 * 		gridData.verticalAlignment = WGridData::FILL;
 * 		gridData.grabExcessHorizontalSpace = true;
 * 		gridData.grabExcessVerticalSpace = true;
 * 		gridData.horizontalSpan = 2;
 * 		button2.SetLayoutData(gridData);
 * </pre>
 * The second is to take advantage of <code>WGridData</code> convenience constructors, for example:
 * <pre>
 *      button1.SetLayoutData(WGridData (WGridData::FILL, WGridData::CENTER, true, false));
 *      button2.SetLayoutData(WGridData (WGridData::FILL, WGridData::FILL, true, true, 2, 1));
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Do not reuse <code>WGridData</code> objects. Every control in a
 * <code>Composite</code> that is managed by a <code>WGridLayout</code>
 * must have a unique <code>WGridData</code> object. If the layout data
 * for a control in a <code>WGridLayout</code> is null at layout time,
 * a unique <code>WGridData</code> object is created for it.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see WGridLayout
 * @see WControl#setLayoutData
