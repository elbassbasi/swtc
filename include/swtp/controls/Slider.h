/**
 * Instances of this class are selectable user interface
 * objects that represent a range of positive, numeric values.
 * <p>
 * At any given moment, a given slider will have a
 * single 'selection' that is considered to be its
 * value, which is constrained to be within the range of
 * values the slider represents (that is, between its
 * <em>minimum</em> and <em>maximum</em> values).
 * </p><p>
 * Typically, sliders will be made up of five areas:
 * <ol>
 * <li>an arrow button for decrementing the value</li>
 * <li>a page decrement area for decrementing the value by a larger amount</li>
 * <li>a <em>thumb</em> for modifying the value by mouse dragging</li>
 * <li>a page increment area for incrementing the value by a larger amount</li>
 * <li>an arrow button for incrementing the value</li>
 * </ol>
 * Based on their style, sliders are either <code>HORIZONTAL</code>
 * (which have a left facing button for decrementing the value and a
 * right facing button for incrementing it) or <code>VERTICAL</code>
 * (which have an upward facing button for decrementing the value
 * and a downward facing buttons for incrementing it).
 * </p><p>
 * On some platforms, the size of the slider's thumb can be
 * varied relative to the magnitude of the range of values it
 * represents (that is, relative to the difference between its
 * maximum and minimum values). Typically, this is used to
 * indicate some proportional value such as the ratio of the
 * visible area of a document to the total amount of space that
 * it would take to display it. SWT supports setting the thumb
 * size even if the underlying platform does not, but in this
 * case the appearance of the slider will not change.
